# Future Works & Improvements

## 1. Model Optimization
- [ ] **Dynamic Decision Threshold**: 
    - Current: Fixed at 0.60 for BUY signal.
    - Proposal: Lower to 0.55 for stable stocks (NABIL) or use a per-stock threshold based on validation results to balance Precision vs Recall.
- [ ] **Hyperparameter Tuning**: 
    - Implement `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` for LSTM and RandomForest.
    - Tune `seq_len` (currently 30), `dropout` (0.3), and `n_estimators`.
- [ ] **Feature Engineering**:
    - Add "Market Regime" feature: Is NEPSE Index > SMA_200? (Bull/Bear filter).
    - Add "Sector Trend": Relative strength of the Banking sector vs NEPSE.

## 2. Data Pipeline
- [ ] **Automated Retraining**: Implement a weekly job to retrain models on new data.
- [ ] **Data Quality Checks**: Add alerts if scraped data volume deviates from average (e.g., volume spike or zero volume).
- [ ] **News Sentiment**: Integrate financial news sentiment analysis as a feature.

## 4. Financial RAG Chatbot (Advanced)
- [ ] **Goal**: Create a "NEPSE-GPT" that answers user questions like "Should I buy NABIL?" by synthesizing:
    1.  **Internal Data**: Our model's forecasts, DB records, and technical indicators (RSI, MACD).
    2.  **External Data**: Real-time news/sentiment from the web (via Search API).
    3.  **LLM Reasoning**: Use OpenAI/Gemini API to generate advice.
- [ ] **Tech Stack Proposal**:
    -   **Orchestration**: LangChain or LlamaIndex.
    -   **Vector DB**: PGVector (supported by Neon!) to store news embeddings.
    -   **Retriever**: Fetch `ModelMetaData` (accuracy), `ForecastResult` (signals), and recent News.
        -   **Option A (API)**: OpenAI/Gemini (Easier, Pay-per-token).
        -   **Option B (Self-Hosted & Specialized - CHOSEN)**:
            -   **Core**: Run Llama 3 via Ollama locally.
            -   **Specialization**: Feed it exclusively NEPSE data (Reports, News, Our Indicators) via RAG.
            -   **Why**: This creates a "Domain Expert" without sending data to OpenAI. 100% Private & Free.
- [ ] **Workflow**:
    -   User asks: "Analyze NTC".
    -   System fetches: NTC's RSI (35), Model Signal (Buy), Web News ("NTC profited 2B").
    -   LLM Output: "Our model predicts BUY (conf 65%) because RSI is low... however, external news suggests..."
